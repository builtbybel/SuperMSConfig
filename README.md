# MSConfig Gets Superpowers After 25 Years â€“ Now It's SuperMSConfig ðŸ˜ƒ

We all know MSConfig, the tool that helps you manage some system settings. SuperMSConfig takes things a step further by automating many of these tasks

SuperMSConfig is an advanced and fully automated alternative to the traditional MSConfig tool, designed specifically for Windows 11. Unlike the classic MSConfig, which focuses on modifying startup parameters or disabling device drivers, SuperMSConfig takes a broader approach as a comprehensive system checker. It scans your system for Windows 11's most annoying configurations and bad habits, such as unwanted services, sneaky startup apps, intrusive browser tweaks, system configurations, unnecessary updates, security settings, ads, and more.

SuperMSConfig started out as a simple plugin for [XD-AntiSpy](https://github.com/builtbybel/xd-AntiSpy), but it grew into its own app because it became more complex and feature-packed. While XD-AntiSpy mainly focuses on boosting privacy, SuperMSConfig takes a broader approach, helping you analyse an clean up different parts of your Windows system. The two apps work great together, with SuperMSConfig handling the overall system management while XD-AntiSpy focuses on privacy.

**My plan with SuperMSConfig is to create a dynamic tool that lets you turn almost any online guide, tutorial, or configuration into a shareable template, available for everyone to use. This way, anyone can show off their Super Microsoft configuration setup. ðŸ˜‰**
