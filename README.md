# MSConfig Gets Superpowers After 25 Years ‚Äì Now It's SuperMSConfig üòÉ

We all know MSConfig, the tool that helps you manage some system settings. SuperMSConfig takes things a step further by automating many of these tasks

Built specifically for Windows 11, it not only enhances system configuration but also customizes your system right after installation by revisiting the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE), ensuring your Windows setup starts off perfectly.

## What Does SuperMSConfig Do? üéØ
While MSConfig traditionally allows you to manage startup settings and system drivers, SuperMSConfig goes much further:

- Reconfigures Windows 11 OOBE: SuperMSConfig revisits the out-of-box setup, letting you fine-tune the Windows 11 post-installation experience. Whether it‚Äôs disabling intrusive features or optimizing services, it provides full control over how your system behaves immediately after setup.

- Automates MSConfig: It streamlines and automates MSConfig tasks, eliminating the hassle of manual configuration. SuperMSConfig scans your system to detect unnecessary startup apps, services, and system tweaks‚Äîcleaning up what slows down your PC.

- Comprehensive System Checker: It checks for Windows 11‚Äôs bad habits‚Äîunwanted services, sneaky startup programs, intrusive browser settings, system configurations, unwanted updates, security settings, ads, and much more.

## How SuperMSConfig Enhances Windows 11‚Äôs OOBE üíª
Unlike the default Windows 11 setup, which can leave unnecessary features enabled by default, SuperMSConfig revisits the Out-of-Box Experience after installation, giving you control over:

- Disabling annoying ads and unwanted telemetry
- Tweaking system settings for better performance and privacy
- **Optimizing configurations that Windows leaves on by default, improving your user experience right from the start**


## Origins: Born from XD-AntiSpy üõ°Ô∏è
SuperMSConfig began as a simple [XD-AntiSpy](https://github.com/builtbybel/xd-AntiSpy), an app focused on improving privacy. However, it evolved into its own standalone tool with broader system management features. XD-AntiSpy remains a great companion for privacy tweaks, while SuperMSConfig handles the overall system management, making them the perfect duo.

**My plan with SuperMSConfig is to create a dynamic tool that lets you turn almost any online guide, tutorial, or configuration into a shareable template, available for everyone to use. This way, anyone can show off their Super Microsoft configuration setup. üòâ**
